# Oracles

Explore how oracles on the Bitlayer network enable smart contracts to seamlessly access real-world data, such as asset prices and external events. Oracles act as a bridge between the blockchain and off-chain data, ensuring smart contracts can execute based on accurate, decentralized information. This integration expands the capabilities of smart contracts, allowing for more complex and dynamic applications within the Bitlayer ecosystem.
