# FAQ

### Q: Is Bitlayer EVM compatible?
A: Yes, Bitlayer is EVM-compatible. Bitlayer's deep integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) heralds a significant advancement for the Bitcoin network, enabling it to support smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) natively. This compatibility breaks new ground by combining Bitcoin's renowned security and liquidity with Ethereum's programmability and flexibility. For developers and users, this means the ability to deploy Ethereum-based applications directly on Bitcoin, leveraging the best of both worlds: the robustness of Bitcoin's blockchain with the dynamic capabilities of Ethereum's smart contract environment.
