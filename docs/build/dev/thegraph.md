The graph will support bitlayer soon, bitlayer self hosting service is available for use now.

You can migrate your subgraph from self hosting to offical environment when the graph enables bitlayer.

To migrate smoothly, please set dataSources.source.startBlock in subgraph.yaml, we suggest using the block in which the contract was created.
